## What is this?
### This is a collection of packages that slow down, collect unnecessary information, or otherwise negatively impact you or your device. This mainly targets apps that come pre-installed when you buy your device.

## What devices are currently supported?
### Currently, only Samsung Devices are supported. More will be soon!

## Can I contribute?
### Absolutely! If you want to submit a pull request, please include the full package name. Example: com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox //Google App. You can also provide a list of packages that come pre-installed on a specific device. To do this, you can use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to list all installed packages. If you chose to do this, please ensure your device only has applications that came pre-installed on your device.
